The global burden of chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) largely heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes is increasing rapidly and will have signiﬁcant social, economic, and health consequences unless it is urgently addressed (Sheikh Mohammed Shariful Islam, 2014; Niloofar Peykari, 2017). NCDs have been primarily related to four major risk factors: tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol and unhealthy diets (increased fat and sodium, with low fruit and vegetable intake). In 2016, NCDs were responsible annually for more than 38 million deaths and responsible for 16 million premature deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2020, NCD’s will account for 80 percent of global burden of disease, causing seven out of every ten deaths in developing countries about half of them premature deaths under the age of 70. Eighty percent of these deaths are already occurring in low-and middle-income countries. Merriam Webster Dictionary, (2016) defines NCDs as medical condition that is not capable of being communicated by direct contact. Because NCDs are largely preventable, these deaths can be signiﬁcantly reduced (Leanne Riley, January 2016).
